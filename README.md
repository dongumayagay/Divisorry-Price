then install the dependencies with your package manager of choice ( npm, yarn, pnpm )

```
# for npm
npm install

# for yarn
yarn

# for pnpm
pnpm install

```

## Developing

start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
