## Developing

```bash
# run web server
npm run dev

# run wed server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open

#run web server and expost to local network
npm run dev -- --host

```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
